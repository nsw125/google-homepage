The purpose of this program is to best recreate the visual style of the Google homepage, to learn beginner HTML coding and CSS styles. There will be no functionality to the webpage.

Skills learned:

-A beginning understanding of how to build a webpage, and in what priority some elements must be implemented.
-A bit of troubleshooting involved to find what I think is the most concise and efficient code to be used (I'm 1000% sure it's not.)
-A lot of alignment properties, and working with div's and boxes.
-A small understanding of how elements work/organize/present themselves on a webpage.
